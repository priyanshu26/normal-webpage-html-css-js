            <div class="sectionSubtag small-text">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled
                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and
                implementation were determined legally by each of India’s constitutional states.</div>

            <div class="sectionSubtag small-text">The central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the
                "10+2" pattern of education. In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years in
                Junior colleges (Mumbai, Maharashtra), and then 3 years of study for a bachelor's degree for
                college. The first 10 years is further subdivided into 4 years of primary education, 6 years of High
                School followed by 2 years of Junior colleges. This pattern originated from the recommendation of
                the Education Commission of 1964–66.

                There are two types of educational institutions in India, 1) Recognized institutions – primary school,
                secondary school, special schools, intermediate schools, colleges and universities who follow courses as
                prescribed by D.P.I. , universities or boards and they are also open for inspection by these authorities
                 Unrecognized Institutions, which do not follow conditions as said in the recognised ones.</div>

            <div class="sectionSubtag small-text">Following India's independence, a number of rules were formulated for the backward Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes of India. In 1960, a list identifying 405 Scheduled Castes and 225 Scheduled Tribes was published by the central government. An amendment was made to the list in 1975, which identified 841 Scheduled Castes and 510 Scheduled Tribes. The total percentage of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes combined was found to be 22.5% with the Scheduled Castes accounting for 17% and the Scheduled Tribes accounting for the remaining 7.5%. Following the report many Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes increasingly referred to themselves as Dalit, a Marathi language terminology used by B R Ambedkar which literally means "oppressed".</div>
